`mêmechose` is a simple URL-shortening service.
Given a valid URL, it will return a 7 character URL which redirects back to the original URL.

To run the service:

- Make sure to include a .env file with the value `DB_DATA_PATH`, all other values are optional.
- Run `docker-compose up --build -d db` to build DB container.
- Install requirements (ideally to a virtual env) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to perform initial migrations once the DB is up and running.
- Run `python manage.py runserver {port}`, e.g 8000.

To create a short URL, use a POST request with the following body:
```
{"url": "https://myawesomeurl.com/toolongthough"}
```

To use a short URL generated by `mêmechose`, use a GET request:
```
http://localhost:{port}/s/soSh0rT/
```
